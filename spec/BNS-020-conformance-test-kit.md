# BNS-020: BioNexus Conformance Test Kit (BCTK) Development Diagnostic Standard

**Status**: Development / Not Certifiable | **Version**: 0.2-trust-reset | **Supersedes**: none  
**Applies to**: `src/bionexus/bctk/`, `bctk` CLI, `bionexus conformance`, all third-party agents, plugins, workflows, and analysis packages.

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Ecosystem Philosophy

The **BioNexus Conformance Test Kit (BCTK)** is currently a target-bound
development diagnostic for scientific AI agents, plugins, computational workflows,
and analysis tools. It does not issue certification or endorsement.

Drawing inspiration from the **OpenTelemetry (OTel) Compliance Model**, BioNexus explicitly decouples **compliance testing** from **internal tool usage**:

> BioNexus does not require third-party tools to use its pipelines. During the
> Scientific Trust Reset, BCTK scores are internal diagnostics only. A third party
> MUST NOT claim BioNexus conformance from a BCTK run.

Any third-party Agent, Plugin, Tool, Nextflow Workflow, Python Package, or MCP Server can test compliance by running:
```bash
bctk test <target>
# or
bionexus conformance test <target>
```

## 2. The 8 Normative Conformance Dimensions

## 4. Suspended Tier Mapping

The historical GOLD/SILVER/BRONZE thresholds are retained only as an unverified
`diagnostic_tier` for migration and calibration research. Every report MUST set
`conformance_tier=NOT_ASSESSED`, `badge_eligible=false`, and
`trust_decision=NOT_ASSESSED` until an independent certification authority and
target-bound evidence protocol are operational.

| Diagnostic mapping | Minimum Overall Score | Backend Identity (BN-F010) | Abstention (BNS-005) | Critical Failures Allowed |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **GOLD** | **>= 95.0%** | **100% PASS** | **100% PASS** | **0** |
| **SILVER** | **>= 85.0%** | **100% PASS** | **100% PASS** | **0** |
| **BRONZE** | **>= 70.0%** | Any non-masquerading state | **>= 80% PASS** | **0** |
| **NON_CONFORMANT** | < 70.0% | Any BN-F010 violation | < 80% | >= 1 |

---

## 5. Evidence Binding, Signature, and Revocation

Every diagnostic report binds the sorted target file bytes into
`target_content_sha256` and hashes the complete report payload. The report hash is
an integrity checksum, not a signature or attestation.

`bctk badge` and `--badge` MUST fail closed. Future certification evidence MUST use
`bionexus.evidence-attestation.v1`: Ed25519 over a canonical payload containing the
artifact SHA-256, an explicitly trusted key, an expiry interval, and signed
revocation checks. No default BioNexus self-signing key is trusted. These controls
are research integrity mechanisms and do not claim regulatory electronic-signature
compliance.

BNS-022 additionally requires institutional separation: the SSC may define the
technical conformance specification but may not assess a named implementation;
commercial operators may not select assessors or issue certificates; and only a
recognized independent conformity assessment body may issue, suspend, or revoke
a future certificate. Cryptographic validity alone does not satisfy these
governance and impartiality gates.

## 6. Independently adoptable protocol profiles

- **BNS-CT-001** BCTK MUST publish profile results for `BNS-Core`,
  `BNS-Warrant`, `BNS-Provenance`, `BNS-Agent`, `BNS-Validation`, and
  `BNS-Full` so an implementation can adopt a bounded contract surface.
- **BNS-CT-002** A mandatory dimension that is missing, skipped,
  `NOT_APPLICABLE`, or `NOT_ASSESSED` MUST make its profile `NOT_ASSESSED`.
- **BNS-CT-003** A failed mandatory dimension MUST make its profile fail; a
  score from other dimensions MUST NOT average away the failure.
- **BNS-CT-004** `BNS-Full` MUST be deterministically derived from the component
  profiles and MUST NOT pass while any component is failed or unassessed.
- **BNS-CT-005** Profile results are technical diagnostics and MUST retain
  `certification_effect=NONE` while BNS-GV-020 is unmet.

---

## 7. Normative Conformance Test Suite (BCTS) & Automated Verification

- **BNS-CT-006** The standard MUST maintain an authoritative machine-readable
  test suite manifest (`standards/conformance-test-suite/manifest.json`) adhering to
  `schemas/conformance/conformance-suite.schema.json` with positive, negative, and
  adversarial test fixtures for all 8 dimensions.
- **BNS-CT-007** Conformance test runners MUST output a validated JSON audit report
  conforming to `schemas/conformance/conformance-report.schema.json`, including candidate
  provenance, target content SHA-256 hash, dimension-level pass/fail statistics,
  profile fulfillment decisions, and canonical integrity digests.
- **BNS-CT-008** `tools/validate_conformance.py` MUST be executed in all specification
  CI pipelines to guarantee test vector validity, runner correctness, and schema adherence.

---

## 8. "BNS-conformant" Badge Program & Verifiability

- **BNS-CT-009** The "BNS-conformant" badge is governed by `standards/bns-badge/SPECIFICATION.md`
  and `standards/bns-badge/BADGING_POLICY.md`. Every emitted badge MUST be
  cryptographically bound to a valid Conformance Test Report digest and MUST NOT claim
  CAB accreditation unless certified under BNS-022.
